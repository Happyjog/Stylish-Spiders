            <p class="toc-text">The calendar displays the daycare's operational days and the availability of staff. It provides parents with a clear view of when the daycare is open, any holidays or closures, and the staffing schedule. This section is essential for parents to plan their childcare needs, ensuring they know when their child can be enrolled and which staff members will be present to care for them. It promotes transparency and helps parents coordinate their schedules with the daycare's availability.</p>
            <p class="toc-text">This section outlines the daily routines and activities for different age groups, including babies, toddlers, and preschoolers. Each age group has a tailored schedule that reflects their developmental needs and learning objectives. For example, babies may have more frequent feeding and nap times, while toddlers and preschoolers might engage in structured play, educational activities, and social interactions. This helps parents understand what their child will experience throughout the day and ensures that each child receives age-appropriate care and learning opportunities.</p>
            <p class="toc-text">The check-in form is a digital tool that allows parents to officially register their child upon arrival at the daycare. This form typically includes fields for the child's name, arrival time, and any special instructions or notes for the caregivers. It streamlines the check-in process, ensuring that staff are informed about each child's needs and that attendance is accurately recorded. This section enhances safety and communication between parents and daycare staff, making the drop-off process more efficient. </p>
